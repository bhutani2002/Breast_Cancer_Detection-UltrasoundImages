# Breast_Cancer_Detection-UltrasoundImages

A dataset is taken from kaggle and is worked upon by making a Sequential model. Here, the images are resized,reshaped and processed based on the what the model takes in(No ImageDataGenerator is used). Then a model is built and trained on the given dataset and then gets us the predictions on the remaining dataset and from which the output is shown through the confusion matrix.
